# kafka-connect-demo

Demonstration of Kafka Connect Couchbase.

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* bash
* curl 
* Java JDK 1.8

## Set up Couchbase Server

1. Start the Couchbase Docker container:

       ./setup-couchbase.sh

2. Visit http://localhost:8091/ and configure the cluster with username `Administrator` and password `password`.
Optional: Configure disk, memory & services; reduce the Data service memory quota to 512 MB and disable all other services.

3. In the Couchbase web UI, go to the "Buckets" section and follow the link to add sample buckets. Add the `travel-sample` bucket.

4. Return to the "Buckets" section and add two more buckets, `dest` and `dest-routes`.
Reduce the bucket memory quota to 100 MB. Enable "Flush" in the "Advanced Settings" section.

## Set up Kafka

1. Start the Confluent Kafka containers:

       ./setup-kafka.sh

It takes a long time for the containers to actually finish starting up.
Eventually you will be able to visit http://localhost:9021/ to see the Confluent Control Center.

While you're waiting for Kafka start, move on to the next step.

## Set up connect-cli tool

0. Install gradle 5 : follow instruction in the url below:
   
    https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gradle-on-ubuntu-18-04/

1. Download and build the `connect-cli` tool:

       ./setup-connect-cli.sh
       
2. Add the tool to your PATH environment variable:

       export PATH=$(pwd)/tmp/kafka-connect-tools/bin:${PATH}

3. Try listing installed connectors:

       connect-cli ps

If the "connect" Kafka container has finished starting up, the tool should report "No running connectors".

## Start a Source connector

Kafka connectors are created and controlled by POSTing JSON to an HTTP server.
The `connect-cli` tool handles that for us, and also handles converting property files to JSON. 
 
    connect-cli run cb-source < config/source-1-default-schema.properties

To watch the connector service log file:

    docker logs -f connect

If all goes well, the connector will populate the `connect-demo` topic with documents from the `travel-sample` bucket.

## Start a Sink connector

Let's write those documents back to Couchbase in the `dest` bucket.

    connect-cli run cb-sink < config/sink-1-dest.properties    

## Experiment with other configurations

The config directory has a few other source and sink configurations to play with.
To re-stream the Couchbase documents, first delete the source connector:

    connect-cli rm cb-source

Then recreate it using the desired config.

## Modifying the custom source handler

After modifying the source code for `CustomSourceHandler` (located under the `custom-extensions` directory) you'll need to restart the Kafka containers in order for the new version to be active:

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v
    ./setup-kafka.sh

## Clean up

When you're done with the demo, remove the Docker containers:

    ./cleanup.sh
